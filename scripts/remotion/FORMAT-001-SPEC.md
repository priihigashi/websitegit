## Phases & Timing

### Phase 1 — Hook Intro (frames 0–150 = 5 seconds)
**Purpose**: scroll-stopper. Large bold question/claim in the first 5 seconds.

- Full-width semi-opaque dark overlay ON TOP of the video zone
- Hook text: Fraunces serif, bold, ~110px, paper color, centered
- Text-shadow for readability over any video background
- Opacity animation: fade in 0→8 frames, hold 8→140, fade out 140→150
- During hook: `topicTitle` strip HIDDEN (hook occupies that visual space)
- During hook: source video plays at 60% opacity underneath (context visible)
- After frame 150: hook overlay disappears, video returns to 100% opacity
- If `hook` prop is empty or not provided → skip this phase entirely, Phase 2 starts at frame 0

### Phase 2 — Main Content (frames 150+ or 0+ if no hook)
- Source video at 100% opacity, `objectPosition: "50% {videoOffsetY}"`
- `topicTitle` strip appears at top of video zone (if provided)
- Speaker lower-third name badge (if `speakerName` provided)
- SRT captions burned in over video
- Gold divider at 1114px
- Proof slides animate in at their `startFrame`

## Props Reference

| Prop | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `videoSrc` | string | ✅ | Path to source clip (always `./public/source_clip.mp4`) |
| `videoStartFrame` | number | — | Frame in source clip to start from (skip intro) |
| `hook` | string | — | **Bold hook text** shown in first 5 seconds. Large, centered. |
| `proofSlides` | ProofSlide[] | — | Bottom-zone fact cards (timed). Empty = dark zone. |
| `captions` | CaptionEntry[] | — | SRT caption entries (burned in over video) |
| `language` | "en" \| "pt" | ✅ | Language (affects composition ID) |
| `totalFrames` | number | ✅ | Total duration in frames |
| `speakerName` | string | — | Lower-third name (e.g., "Marianne Williamson") |
| `speakerRole` | string | — | Lower-third role (e.g., "Author & Activist") |
| `topicTitle` | string | — | Small topic strip at top of video zone (e.g., "REGIME CHANGE") |
| `videoOffsetY` | string | — | Vertical crop anchor, default `"15%"`. Higher % = lower crop start |
| `voiceover_url` | string | — | Path to voiceover MP3 in public/ dir |

## Face Framing Rule

- **Source format**: always 9:16 vertical (Instagram/TikTok reels)
- **`objectFit: "cover"`** + **`objectPosition: "50% 15%"`** (default)
  - Horizontal: centered (50%)
  - Vertical: 15% from top — shows speaker's head/face which is typically in the upper 20-40% of a talking-head reel
- **`videoOffsetY` prop** allows per-render adjustment: 
  - `"0%"` = anchored to very top (old behavior — can cut top of head if strip covers it)
  - `"15%"` = default, good for most talking-head reels
  - `"25%"` = use when speaker is positioned lower in frame

---

## Proof Slide Rules

- At least 1 proof slide required to show content in bottom zone (empty = dark)
- Each slide: `headline` (bold claim) + `fact` (supporting detail) + `source` (attribution)
- Optional `imageUrl`: grayscale image fills left 50% of proof zone
- `startFrame` + `durationFrames` control when each slide appears
- Slides are exclusive — only one is active at a time

---

## Auto-Trigger Rule

**render-video.yml is ALWAYS manual** (`workflow_dispatch`).
The capture pipeline does NOT auto-trigger it. Capture completion email says:
> "Next step: trigger render-video.yml manually via Actions tab with story_id=..."

Never wire capture → render automatically without an explicit approved `render_video` flag.

## What Was Approved (git reference)

- `850f53c` — SOVEREIGN FORMAT-001 initial build (split-screen, captions, proof zone)
- `523f1f1` — Renamed to NewsReel, added speaker/topic strip params

The `topicTitle` strip was always small (28px). The **hook intro sequence** is NEW (not in original). It was missing — this spec adds it for the first time.
